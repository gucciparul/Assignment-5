# Assignment-5
In this assignment I have taken the Lab 4 where we have studied and rehearsed with Pandas. By the conclusion of this lab, we should be familiar with the various Python techniques for creating columns (both default and calculated), concatenating, appending, renaming, and reordering.
The first part included using the dataset as Salaries.csv for the lab which I have used in this assignment. In the first step, the importing of python libraries are done in which Pandas and numpy are imported.
Then we expand the number of coulumn, define the variables for the csv files.
The second step consists of Concatenating a dataframe and Appending them.
The id, name and age are append.
In the third part, the rename and reorder of the columns are done from rank to original rank.
The fourth part consists of groupby case and whereby statement on the basis of rank and sex columns. We are applying a where condition to filter the data where sex equals to male and case statement where salary is greater than 90000 or smaller than 90000.
